The program is written in Python 2.6 with numpy package
How to run the program:

    python init.py
========================================================
Note: These nine files should be in the same directory
    -init.py
    —preprocessing.py
    -NavieBayes.py
    -knn.py
    —amazon_cell_labelled.txt
    -imdb_labelled.txt
    —yelp_labelled.txt
    -stopWords.txt
    -internetSlangs.txt
=========================================================
The program will give the all output generated by KNN and Naive Bayes
for one split set of training, validation, testing data;
The default split is (0.7, 0.15, 0.15)

    The output will be in the following format:
    (1)original feature size
    (2)pruned feature size
    (3)The time to build original KNN by choosing the best k_nearest
    (4)k size for original feature set
    (5)accuracy for original training, validation, testing feature set in KNN
    (6)time to classify a new original tuple in KNN
    (7)The time to build pruned KNN by choosing the best k_nearest
    (8)k size for pruned feature set
    (9)accuracy for pruned training, validation, testing feature set in KNN
    (10)time to classify a new pruned tuple in KNN
    (11)The time to build original Naive Bayes Classifier
    (12)accuracy for original training, validation, testing set in Naive Bayes Classifier
    (13)time to classify a new original tuple in Naive Bayes
    (14)The time to build pruned Naive Bayes Classifier
    (15)accuracy for pruned training, validation,testing set in Naive Bayes Classifier
    (16)time to classify a new pruned tuple in Naive Bayes
=============================================================
To compute the performance under different split, we have to change the 
parameter in line 129, 130, 131 in the "init.py" file mannually
