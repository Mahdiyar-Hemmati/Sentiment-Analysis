How to interpret the resulting output:

    There will be three output files.
    (1)merge.txt: it shows the result of merging three input files.
    (2)words.txt: it shows the words analyzed by all input data sets.
    (3)labels.txt: it shows the labels from each sentence
    (4)frequency_matrix.txt: it shows the feature vector for each sentence in the data set. The value of each column corresponds to the frequency of word in the same column of words.txt.
